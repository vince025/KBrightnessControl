A simpe Brightness Control tool with Qt. Only run for AMD graphics card.
And it need you to install the aticonfig command. Install the AMD ATI Driver, it will install the aticonfig.

I test it in Kubuntu12.04 and pass. My graphics card is HD 7470M.

This is a QtCreator Project, open the .pro project file, and compile it!
No wiki, because is so simple.
